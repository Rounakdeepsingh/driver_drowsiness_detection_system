Driver Drowsiness Detection

Overview

Driver drowsiness detection is a crucial technology that helps prevent road accidents caused by fatigue. This project utilizes computer vision techniques to monitor a driver's eye state and sound an alarm if signs of drowsiness are detected.

Features

Real-time face and eye detection using OpenCV's Haar cascades.

Continuous monitoring of the driver's eye state.

Audio alert system to wake up the driver when drowsiness is detected.

Project Structure

Driver_Drowsiness_Detection/
|-- alarm.wav                          # Alert sound file for drowsiness detection
|-- haarcascade_eye.xml                # Haar cascade model for eye detection
|-- haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml # Haar cascade model for face detection
|-- monitoring.py                       # Main script for drowsiness detection

Requirements

Ensure you have the following dependencies installed before running the project:

Python 3.x

OpenCV (cv2)

NumPy

Pygame (for playing the alarm sound)

Install the dependencies using:

pip install opencv-python numpy pygame

Usage

Run the script:

python monitoring.py

The webcam will start detecting the driver's face and eyes.

If drowsiness is detected, an alarm sound (alarm.wav) will play to alert the driver.

Future Improvements

Implement deep learning-based eye state classification for better accuracy.

Optimize performance for low-power devices.

Add support for multi-threading to enhance real-time processing.
